# node101-hello-http-server

The purpose of this project was to build a very simple web server that only responded to a basic request for a localhost. In addition, the server only logged each request to the server-side console. With this, I was able to see all the visits my site generated. The exit criteria of this project included:
- server responded to GET requests with the text "Hello World"
- server responded with a status code of 200
- server logged each request path 
- server indicated when it was listening and on what port
- all tests passed
